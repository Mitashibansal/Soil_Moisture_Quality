## Aim:
Current methods for sensing soil moisture are problematic -- buried sensors are susceptible to salts in the substrate and require specialised hardware for connections, while thermal imaging cameras are expensive and can be compromised by climatic conditions such as sunlight intensity, fog, and clouds.
## Overview:
 * App determine moisture content based on a standard image/ video by analysing the differences in soil colour to determine moisture content. 
 * An artificial neural network (ANN) /machine learning software can be trained to recognise different soil moisture levels under different sky conditions. This monitoring system could potentially be trained to recognise the specific soil conditions of any location, allowing it to be customised for each user and updated for changing climatic circumstances, ensuing maximum accuracy. 
 * This app may be a promising  tool for improved irrigation technologies in agriculture in terms of cost, availability and accuracy under changing climatic conditions.
